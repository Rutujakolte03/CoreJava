//Q1. Write a java program to check whether the number is Spy or not (Spy number is the number in which suppose 123 in that addition of 123 is 6 and multiplication of 123 is 6)
//Q2. Write a java program to check whether the number is Strong number or not (Strong number is the number in which sum of the factorial of each number is same as the original number supppose 145 factorial of 1 is 1, 4 is 24, 5 is 120 addition of 1+24+120 is 145)
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Spy {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the number");
        int num = sc.nextInt();
        int addition = sc.nextInt();
        int multiplication = sc.nextInt();
        int c = addition = multiplication;
    }
